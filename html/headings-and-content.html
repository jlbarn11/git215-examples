			<h1>Using Heading Levels and Grouping Content by Topic</h1>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>The content below is simple, but not how items are grouped in the main and which heading levels are used. Remember, sections, asides, and articles are semantic containers, and semantic containers require headings. Each section below has a border added to help you see the grouping on the page. Outer section borders are <span class="maroon-border">maroon</span>, nested section borders are <span class="gray-border">gray</span>.</p>

				<h2>HTML</h2>
				<p>HTML defines a webpage's structure and content.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>HTML Tags</h3>
					<p>Some HTML tags use an opening and closing pair of tags to surround
					content. These wrap around that content and help to define what it is.
					Others only require a single tag for markup. Those are called void tags.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
					<p>In HTML, attributes are always added to the opening HTML tag in the pair.
					If there is no closing tag, the attribute will be placed in the void tag
					itself. All attributes should be added with lowercase letters and double
					quotation marks where needed.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>CSS</h2>
				<p>CSS specifies a webpage's layout and visible appearance.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
					<p>In CSS, you can change the appearance of elements on your pages to
					make them more pleasing to look at and use. CSS selectors allow you to
					target the elements on your page by tag name, attribute, relationship,
					class, ID, and more.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript describes a webpage's dynamic behaviors and actions.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>When to Use JavaScript</h3>
					<p>Generally, you want to use JavaScript only when necessary, to
					improve user experience. Many companies and IT teams will disable
					JavaScript on their websites, so your sites should be functional
					without it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
					<p>Today, many job postings will list a desire for experience with
					specific JavaScript frameworks or libraries rather than asking for
					experience with JavaScript itself. This doesn't mean that you don't
					need to learn it! Understanding the language these libraries and
					frameworks are built on, makes it easier to learn them as needed.</p>
