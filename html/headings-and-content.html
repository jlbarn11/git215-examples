        <h2>HTML</h2> 
        <p>HTML defines a webpage's structure and content.</p> 

        <section>
          <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
          <p>Some HTML tags use an opening and closing pair of tags to surround 
          content. These wrap around that content and help to define what it is. 
          Others only require a single tag for markup. Those are called void tags.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
          <p>In HTML, attributes are always added to the opening HTML tag in the pair. 
          If there is no closing tag, the attribute will be placed in the void tag 
          itself. All attributes should be added with lowercase letters and double 
          quotation marks where needed.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2> 
        <p>CSS specifies a webpage's layout and visible appearance.</p> 

        <section>
          <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
          <p>In CSS, you can change the appearance of elements on your pages to
          make them more pleasing to look at and use. CSS selectors allow you to 
          target the elements on your page by tag name, attribute, relationship, 
          class, ID, and more.</p>

      <section> 
        <h2>JavaScript</h2> 
        <p>JavaScript describes a webpage's dynamic behaviors and actions.</p> 

        <section>
          <h3>When to Use JavaScript</h3>
          <p>Generally, you want to use JavaScript only when necessary, to 
          improve user experience. Many companies and IT teams will disable 
          JavaScript on their websites, so your sites should be functional 
          without it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
          <p>Today, many job postings will list a desire for experience with 
          specific JavaScript frameworks or libraries rather than asking for 
          experience with JavaScript itself. This doesn't mean that you don't
          need to learn it! Understanding the language these libraries and 
          frameworks are built on, makes it easier to learn them as needed.</p>
